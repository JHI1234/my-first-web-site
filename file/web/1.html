			<h2>What is HTML?</h2>
			<p>
				<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/text-level-semantics.html#the-a-element" target ="_blank" title="HTML5 Specification">HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
				Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
