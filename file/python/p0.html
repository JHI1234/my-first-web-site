			<h2>What is Python?</h2>
			<p>
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)" target="_blank" title="What is Python?">Python</a> is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.
			Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
